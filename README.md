# This script is used for portfolio managament

Sometimes it is just boring to browse all the web pages to see the price of your asset

now you don't need to do that anymore

this script will help you do that instead

I'm modifying this to display more numbers that it can do, like the increase of the price

~~~ terminal
python3 portfolio_managing.py --stock *stock_names
~~~

Only ether now can see the change in crypto, so be patient for the next update
